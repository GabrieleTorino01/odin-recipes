        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>French toast is traditionally made with day-old slices because they absorb the eggy mixture better than fresh ones (and this method prevents waste - it's a win-win). Of course, a slightly stale loaf is certainly not a requirement. If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll work just fine.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (Optional)</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon (Optional)</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>6 thick slices bread</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or more as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk milk, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt together in a shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Lightly butter a griddle or skillet and heat over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Dunk bread in the egg mixture, soaking both sides.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the hot skillet and cook until golden, 3 to 4 minutes per side.

            </li>
            <li>Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
