<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Crêpes are very thin pancakes. They can be served with a wide variety of sweet and savory fillings and toppings. The breakfast staple dates back to at least 13th-century France.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>½ cup milk</li>
    <li>½ cup water</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li> flour and eggs together in a large mixing bowl; gradually add in milk and water, stirring to combine. Add salt and melted butter; beat until smooth. </li>
    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
    <li>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.</li>
